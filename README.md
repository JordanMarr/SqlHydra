# SqlHydra
SqlHydra is a set of NuGet packages for working with databases in F# with an emphasis on type safety and convenience.


### SqlHydra.Cli
[SqlHydra.Cli](#sqlhydracli-) is a dotnet tool that generates F# types and readers for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite databases.

### SqlHydra.Query
[SqlHydra.Query](#sqlhydraquery-) provides strongly typed Linq queries against generated types. 
        
#### Notes
- The generated code can be used alone or with any query library for creating strongly typed table records and data readers.
- SqlHydra.Query is designed to be used with SqlHydra generated types. (If you would prefer to create your own types over using generated types, then I would recommend checking out [Dapper.FSharp](https://github.com/Dzoukr/Dapper.FSharp).)
- SqlHydra.Query uses [SqlKata](https://sqlkata.com/) internally to generate provider-specific SQL queries.
- _All SqlHydra NuGet packages will be released with matching major and minor version numbers._

<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!


## Contributing
* This project uses the vs-code Remote-Containers extension to spin up a dev environment that includes databases for running the Tests project.
* Alternatively, you can manually run the docker-compose file to load the development databases along with your IDE of choice.
* [Contributing Wiki](https://github.com/JordanMarr/SqlHydra/wiki/Contributing)


## SqlHydra.Cli [![NuGet version (SqlHydra.Cli)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SqlHydra.Cli.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SqlHydra.Cli/)

### Local Install (recommended)
Run the following commands from your project directory:
1) `dotnet new tool-manifest`
2) `dotnet tool install SqlHydra.Cli`

### Configure and Run

Run the tool from the command line, passing in a database provider: `mssql`, `npgsql`, `sqlite`, `oracle`

```bat
dotnet sqlhydra mssql
```

* If no .toml configuration file is detected, a configuration wizard will ask you some questions to create a new [.toml configuration](https://github.com/JordanMarr/SqlHydra/wiki/TOML-Configuration) file for you, and will then generate code using the new config.
* If a .toml configuration file already exists, it will generate code.
* The generated .fs file will automatically be added to your .fsproj as `Visible="false"`.
* By default, the generated toml file will be named `sqlhydra-{provider}.toml`

### TOML Creation Wizard
The wizard will prompt you for the following input:

```
- Enter a database Connection String:
```
This is the [connection string](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) that SqlHydra can use to query table and column metadata.

```
- Enter an Output Filename (Ex: AdventureWorks.fs):
```
This is the filename that your generated types will be added to. (This file will be automatically added to your fsproj.)

```
- Enter a Namespace (Ex: MyApp.AdventureWorks):
```
This is the namespace that your generated table record types will be created in.

```
- Select a use case:

> SqlHydra.Query integration (default)
  Other data library
  Standalone      
```

Selecting a use case will set the base configuration options in your TOML file. 
* __SqlHydra.Query integration (default)__ should be chosen if you plan on using the SqlHydra.Query NuGet package to query your database using the generated types. This option will generated additional metadata that is utilized by the SqlHydra.Query package to recognize things like provider-specific parameter types. This use case will also generate a `HydraReader` class that SqlHydra.Query depends on for reading data into the generated types.
* __Other data library__ should be chosen if you plan on using a 3rd party data library (ex: Dapper.FSharp, Donald, Npgsql.FSharp, ADO.NET, and many others). This use case only generates the table record types. No `HydraReader` class is generated.
* __Standalone__ means that you will only be using the generated read-only querying methods that will be generated. This use case creates the table record types and the `HydraReader` for reading them. (It does not create the additional metadata used by SqlHydra.Query.)

For more details, see the [.toml configuration](https://github.com/JordanMarr/SqlHydra/wiki/TOML-Configuration).


### Build Event (optional)

To regenerate after a Rebuild, you can run SqlHydra from an fsproj build event:

```bat
  <Target Name="SqlHydra" BeforeTargets="Clean">
    <Exec Command="dotnet sqlhydra mssql" />
  </Target>
```

### Support for Postgres Enums
Postgres enum types are generated as CLR enums!
You will, however, still need to manually "register" your custom enums.

If using `Npgsql` v7 or later:
```F#
// Global mapping should occur only once at startup:
// `experiments.mood` is the generated enum, and "experiments.mood" is the "{schema}.{enum}".
let dataSourceBuilder = NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder(DB.connectionString)
dataSourceBuilder.MapEnum<ext.mood>("ext.mood") |> ignore
```
* See: [Npgsql Docs - type mappings update 1](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/release-notes/7.0.html#managing-type-mappings-at-the-connection-level-is-no-longer-supported)
* See: [Npgsql Docs - type mappings update 2](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/release-notes/7.0.html#global-type-mappings-must-now-be-done-before-any-usage)

If using `Npgsql` v6 or earlier:
```F#
// Global mapping should occur only once at startup:
// `experiments.mood` is the generated enum, and "experiments.mood" is the "{schema}.{enum}".
Npgsql.NpgsqlConnection.GlobalTypeMapper.MapEnum<experiments.mood>(nameof experiments.mood) |> ignore
```
💥 `Npgsql` v8.0.0 fails when inserting an enum. 

### Support for Postgres Arrays
SqlHydra.Cli supports `text[]` and `integer[]` column types.

### Sqlite Data Type Aliases
Sqlite stores all data as either an `INTEGER`, `REAL`, `TEXT` or `BLOB` type.
Fortunately, you can also use aliases for data types more commonly used in other databases in your table definitions and Sqlite will translate them to the appropriate type.
Using these type aliases also allows `SqlHydra.Cli` to generate the desired .NET CLR property type.

Here is a list of valid data type aliases (or "affinity names"):
https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity_name_examples

### SQL Server Troubleshooting

The following exception may occur with the latest version of `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`:
```
Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): 
A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. 
(provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)
```

The most simple way to resolve this is to append `;TrustServerCertificate=True` to the connection string in your .toml configuration file.
UPDATE: This behavior has been fixed in `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` v4.1.1.


## Generated Table Types for AdventureWorks

```F#
// This code was generated by SqlHydra.SqlServer.
namespace SampleApp.AdventureWorks

module dbo =
    type ErrorLog =
        { ErrorLogID: int
          ErrorTime: System.DateTime
          UserName: string
          ErrorNumber: int
          ErrorMessage: string
          ErrorSeverity: Option<int>
          ErrorState: Option<int>
          ErrorProcedure: Option<string>
          ErrorLine: Option<int> }

    type BuildVersion =
        { SystemInformationID: byte
          ``Database Version``: string
          VersionDate: System.DateTime
          ModifiedDate: System.DateTime }

module SalesLT =
    type Address =
        { City: string
          StateProvince: string
          CountryRegion: string
          PostalCode: string
          rowguid: System.Guid
          ModifiedDate: System.DateTime
          AddressID: int
          AddressLine1: string
          AddressLine2: Option<string> }

    type Customer =
        { LastName: string
          PasswordHash: string
          PasswordSalt: string
          rowguid: System.Guid
          ModifiedDate: System.DateTime
          CustomerID: int
          NameStyle: bool
          FirstName: string
          MiddleName: Option<string>
          Title: Option<string>
          Suffix: Option<string>
          CompanyName: Option<string>
          SalesPerson: Option<string>
          EmailAddress: Option<string>
          Phone: Option<string> }
    
    // etc...
```

## Strongly Typed Data Readers
The generated `HydraReader` class works in tandem with SqlHydra.Query for reading queried entities, but it can also be used on its own with any query library that returns an IDataReader.

* [Using HydraReader automatically with SqlHydra.Query](#sqlhydraquery-)
* [Using HydraReader manually with other query libraries](https://github.com/JordanMarr/SqlHydra/wiki/DataReaders)

## TOML Configuration Reference
* [View TOML Configuration Reference](https://github.com/JordanMarr/SqlHydra/wiki/TOML-Configuration)

## Generating Multiple TOML Files

It is also possible to have more than one .toml file in the same project. By default, SqlHydra will create a .toml file named after the version of SqlHydra used.
For example, running `dotnet sqlhydra sqlite` will generate `sqlhydra-sqlite.toml`. 

However, you can also specify a name for your .toml file: `dotnet sqlhydra sqlite -t "shared.toml"`
This can be useful for various use cases, such as:
* data migrations where you want to generate types for a source and a target database.
* generating record types with different schema/table filters in separate files.


## Supported Frameworks
.NET 6 - .NET 8 are currently supported.
(If you still need support for .NET 5, use the deprecated `SqlHydra.SqlServer`, `SqlHydra.Sqlite`, `SqlHydra.Npgsql` or `SqlHydra.Oracle` tools.)

### .NET 6 and Greater
The new .NET 6 `System.DateOnly` and `System.TimeOnly` types are now supported by all generators.

## SqlHydra.Query [![NuGet version (SqlHydra.Query)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SqlHydra.Query.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SqlHydra.Query/)
SqlHydra.Query wraps the powerful [SqlKata](https://sqlkata.com/) query generator with F# computation expression builders for strongly typed query generation.
SqlHydra.Query can be used with any library that accepts a data reader; however, is designed pair well with SqlHydra generated records and readers! 

### Creating a Query Context

```F#
/// Opens a connection and creates a QueryContext that will generate SQL Server dialect queries
let openContext() = 
    let compiler = SqlKata.Compilers.SqlServerCompiler()
    let conn = new SqlConnection("Replace with your connection string")
    conn.Open()
    new QueryContext(conn, compiler)
```

#### Query Logging

You can, optionally, set a logger function that will be executed before a query is run.
This is a handy way to log queries and uses the same API as SqlKata: https://sqlkata.com/docs/execution/logging.
The function take a compiled query as a parameter and returns a unit.

```F#
    let ctx = new QueryContext(conn, compiler)
    #if DEBUG
    ctx.Logger <- printfn "SQL: %O"
    #endif
```

### Tables
SqlHydra v1.2 now generates a table declaration for each table record that can be used in query `from` statements.
For example, if you have a `SalesLT.Person` table record, you will also have a `SalesLT.Person` binding.

```F#
select { 
    for p in SalesLT.Person do
    select p
}
```

### Select Builder

There are three select builders:
* `selectTask` - creates a self-executing query that returns a Task<'T> of query results
* `selectAsync` - creates a self-executing query that returns an Async<'T> of query results
* `select` - creates a query (this is mostly used for creating subqueries)

All three select query builders must be passed the generated `HydraReader.Read` static method (which is generated by `SqlHydra.Cli` when the ["Generate HydraReader?"](#data-readers) option is selected).

The `selectTask` and `selectAsync` builders must also be passed a `QueryType` which is a discriminated union that allows the user to specify the scope of the `QueryContext` (which manages the `DbConnection` and executes the various types of queries). `QueryType` allows for the following options:
* `QueryType.Create of unit -> QueryContext` - this takes a function that returns a new `QueryContext`. This option will create its own `QueryContext` and `DbConnection` automatically, execute the query and then dispose them. This is very useful because it allows you to create a simple data function that executes a query without the need of manually instantiating the `QueryContext`, executing the query and then disposing (which also necessitates wrapping everything in a `task` or `async` block to ensure that the connection isn't prematurely disposed). The end result is a much cleaner data function that doesn't need to be wrapped in a `task` or `async` block!
* `QueryType.Shared of QueryContext` - this takes an already instantiated `QueryContext` and uses it to execute the query. In this case, the builder will ensure that the connection is open before executing the query, but it will not try to close or dispose when it is done. This is useful for when you need to call multiple queries within a `task` or `async` block with a single shared `QueryContext`.


Selecting city and state columns only:
```F#
let getCities (cityFilter: string) = 
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for a in SalesLT.Address do                             // Specifies a FROM table in the query
        where (a.City = cityFilter)                             // Specifies a WHERE clause in the query
        select (a.City, a.StateProvince) into selected          // Specifies which entities and/or columns to SELECT in the query
        mapList (                                               // Transforms the query results
            let city, state = selected
            $"City, State: %s{city}, %s{state}"
        )
    }
```

_Special `where` filter operators:_
- `isIn` or `|=|`
- `isNotIn` or `|<>|`
- `like` or `=%`
- `notLike` or `<>%`
- `isNullValue` or `= None`
- `isNotNullValue` or `<> None`
- `subqueryMany`
- `subqueryOne`


Select `Address` entities where City starts with `S`:
```F#
let getAddressesInCitiesStartingWithS () = 
        selectAsync HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
            for a in SalesLT.Address do
            where (a.City =% "S%")
        }
```

Try to select a single row (this example returns a `decimal option`):
```F#
let tryGetOrderTotal (orderId: int) = 
        selectAsync HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
            for o in SalesLT.Order do
            where (o.Id = orderId)
            select o.Total
            tryHead
        }
```

#### Joins

Select top 10 `Product` entities with inner joined category name:
```F#
let getProductsWithCategory () = 
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for p in SalesLT.Product do
        join c in categoryTable on (p.ProductCategoryID.Value = c.ProductCategoryID)
        select (p, c.Name)
        take 10
    }
```

Select `Customer` with left joined `Address` where `CustomerID` is in a list of values:
(Note that left joined tables will be of type `'T option`, so you will need to use the `.Value` property to access join columns.)

```F#
let getCustomerAddressesInIds (customerIds: int list) =
    selectAsync HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for c in SalesLT.Customer do
        leftJoin ca in SalesLT.CustomerAddress on (c.CustomerID = ca.Value.CustomerID)
        leftJoin a  in SalesLT.Address on (ca.Value.AddressID = a.Value.AddressID)
        where (c.CustomerID |=| customerIds)
        orderBy c.CustomerID
        select (c, a)
    }
```

When selecting individual columns from a left joined table, you can force non-optional columns to be optional by wrapping them in `Some`:

```F#
let getCustomerZipCodes (customerId: int) =
    selectAsync HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for c in SalesLT.Customer do
        leftJoin ca in SalesLT.CustomerAddress on (c.CustomerID = ca.Value.CustomerID)
        leftJoin a  in SalesLT.Address on (ca.Value.AddressID = a.Value.AddressID)
        where (c.CustomerID = customerId)
        orderBy c.CustomerID
        select (c, Some a.Value.ZipCode)
    }
```

To create a join query with multi-columns, use tuples:

```F#
select {
    for o in SalesLT.OrderHeaders do
    join d in SalesLT.OrderDetails on ((o.SalesOrderID, o.ModifiedDate) = (d.SalesOrderID, d.ModifiedDate))
    select (o, d)
}
```

💥 The `join` `on` clause only supports simple column = column comparisons. Constant value parameters are not supported.
Any custom filters that you might normally put in the `on` clause, especially those involving input parameters, will need to be moved to the `where` clause.
This is because the F# `join` `on` syntax does not support complex filter clauses.

#### Transforming Query Results

To transform the query results use the `mapSeq`, `mapArray` or `mapList` operations. 

```F#
    let! lineTotals =
        selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
            for o in SalesLT.OrderHeaders do
            join d in SalesLT.OrderDetails on (o.SalesOrderID = d.SalesOrderID)
            where (o.OnlineOrderFlag = true)
            mapList (
                {| 
                    ShipDate = 
                        match o.ShipDate with
                        | Some d -> d.ToShortDateString()
                        | None -> "No Order Number"
                    LineTotal = (decimal qty) * unitPrice
                |}
            )
        }
```

If a custom subset of entities and/or columns has been selected in the query, you will need to project them into a new binding using the `into` operation:

```F#
    let! lineTotals =
        selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
            for o in SalesLT.OrderHeaders do
            join d in SalesLT.OrderDetails on (o.SalesOrderID = d.SalesOrderID)
            where (o.OnlineOrderFlag = true)
            select (o, d.OrderQty, d.UnitPrice) into selected  // project selected values so they can be mapped
            mapList (
                let o, qty, unitPrice = selected               // unpack the selected values for use in transform
                {| 
                    ShipDate = 
                        match o.ShipDate with
                        | Some d -> d.ToShortDateString()
                        | None -> "No Order Number"
                    LineTotal = (decimal qty) * unitPrice
                |}
            )
        }
```

You can also use `mapSeq` in conjunction with `tryHead` to map a single result:

```F#
        selectAsync HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
            for o in SalesLT.Order do
            where (o.Id = orderId)
            select o.Total
            mapSeq {| GrandTotal = o.Total |}
            tryHead
        }
```


#### Aggregates

_Aggregate functions (can be used in `select`, `having` and `orderBy` clauses):_
- `countBy`
- `sumBy`
- `minBy`
- `maxBy`
- `avgBy`

```F#
/// Select categories with an avg product price > 500 and < 1000
let getCategoriesWithHighAvgPrice () = 
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for p in SalesLT.Product do
        where (p.ProductCategoryID <> None)
        groupBy p.ProductCategoryID
        having (minBy p.ListPrice > 500M && maxBy p.ListPrice < 1000M)
        select (p.ProductCategoryID, minBy p.ListPrice, maxBy p.ListPrice) into selected
        mapList (
            let catId, minPrice, maxPrice = selected
            $"CatID: {catId}, MinPrice: {minPrice}, MaxPrice: {maxPrice}"
        )
    }
```

Alternative Row Count Query:
```F#
let! customersWithNoSalesPersonCount =
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for c in SalesLT.Customer do
        where (c.SalesPerson = None)
        count
    }
```

💥 In some cases when selecting an aggregate of a non-NULL column, the database will still return NULL if the query result set is empty, for example if selecting the MAX of an INT column in an empty table. This is not supported and will throw an exception. If your query might return NULL for the aggregate of a non-NULL column, you may include `Some` in the aggregate to support parsing the NULL as an `Option` value:

❌ INCORRECT:
```F#
/// Select the minimum item price above a threshold
let getNextLowestPrice threshold = 
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for p in SalesLT.Product do
        where (p.ListPrice > threshold)
        select (minBy p.ListPrice)
    }
```

✅ CORRECT:
```F#
/// Select the minimum item price above a threshold
let getNextLowestPrice threshold = 
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for p in SalesLT.Product do
        where (p.ListPrice > threshold)
        select (minBy (Some p.ListPrice))
    }
```


#### WHERE Subqueries

_Use the `subqueryMany` function for subqueries that return multiple rows for comparison:_

```F#
// Create a subquery that gets top 5 avg prices by category ID:
let top5CategoryIdsWithHighestAvgPrices = 
    select {
        for p in SalesLT.Product do
        where (p.ProductCategoryID <> None)
        groupBy p.ProductCategoryID
        orderByDescending (avgBy p.ListPrice)
        select p.ProductCategoryID
        take 5
    }

// Get category names where the category ID is "IN" the subquery:
let! top5Categories =
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for c in SalesLT.ProductCategory do
        where (Some c.ProductCategoryID |=| subqueryMany top5CategoryIdsWithHighestAvgPrices)
        select c.Name
    }
```

_Use the `subqueryOne` function for subqueries that return a single value for comparison:_

```F#
// Create a subquery that gets the avg list price (a single value):
let avgListPrice = 
    select {
        for p in SalesLT.Product do
        select (avgBy p.ListPrice)
    } 

// Get products with a price > the average price
let! productsWithAboveAveragePrice =
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for p in SalesLT.Product do
        where (p.ListPrice > subqueryOne avgListPrice)
        select (p.Name, p.ListPrice)
    }
```

##### Correlated Subqueries

If the subquery is correlated with the parent query (i.e., the subquery references a row variable from the parent query), use the `correlate` keyword in the subquery to introduce the correlated variable. **Note: the variable name in the subquery must match the variable name in the parent query, because it determines the table alias in the generated SQL query.**

```F#
// Create a subquery that gets the min price for this product line,
// referencing a row variable "outer" from the parent query:
let lowestPriceByProductLine = 
    select {
        for inner in Production.Product do
        correlate outer in Production.Product
        where (inner.ProductLine = outer.ProductLine)
        select (minBy inner.ListPrice)
    }

// Get the products whose price is the lowest of all prices in its product line.
// The name "outer" needs to match the subquery.
let! cheapestByProductLine = 
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for outer in Production.Product do
        where (outer.ListPrice = subqueryOne lowestPriceByProductLine)
        select (outer.Name, outer.ListPrice)
    }
```


Distinct Query:
```F#
let! distinctCustomerNames = 
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for c in SalesLT.Customer do
        select (c.FirstName, c.LastName)
        distinct
    }
```

### Dos and Don'ts

:boom: The `select` clause only supports tables and fields for the sake of modifying the generated SQL query and the returned query type `'T`.
Transformations (i.e. `.ToString()` or calling any functions is _not supported_ and will throw an exception.

:boom: The `where` clause will automatically parameterize your input values. _However_, similar to the `select` clause, the `where` clause does not support calling an transformations (i.e. `.ToString()`). So you must prepare any parameter transformations before the builder. 

✅ CORRECT:
```F#
let getCities () =
    let city = getCity() // DO prepare where parameters above and then pass into the where clause
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for a in SalesLT.Address do
        where (a.City = city)
        select (a.City, a.StateProvince) into (city, state)
        mapList $"City: %s{city}, State: %s{state}"   // DO transforms using the `mapSeq`, `mapArray` or `mapList` operations
    }
```

❌ INCORRECT:
```F#
let getCities () =
    selectTask HydraReader.Read (Create openContext) {
        for a in SalesLT.Address do
        where (a.City = getCity()) // DO NOT perform calculations or translations within the builder
        select ($"City: %s{city}, State: %s{state}")   // DO NOT transform results within the builder 
    }
```

### Using the `selectAsync` and `selectTask` Builders
The new `selectAsync` and `selectTask` builders should generally be prefered over the older `select` builder (with the exception of creating subqueries, which must be done using the `select` builder) because they provide several advantages:

#### They are self-executing
The new `selectAsync` and `selectTask` builders will execute the query automatically, whereas the old `select` builder creates a query that must be manually passed into a `QueryContext` execution method. 

#### They offer more explicit control over the `QueryContext` and connection handling
The new `selectAsync` and `selectTask` builders must be initialized with with a `ContextType` discriminated union value that can either be `Shared` or `Create`.
Passing in a `Shared` context will run the query with an already existing `QueryContext`, whereas `Create` will create a new context and dispose it automatically after executing the query. 

#### They make it possible to create a query function that is not wrapped in an `async` or `task` block.
One problem with the `select` builder is that the `QueryContext` generally had to be initialized within the `task` block to ensure that it was not disposed while the task was running asynchronously. Having the ability to initilize  a `selectAsync` or `selectTask` builder with `Create` makes it a completely self-contained query which can exist by itself in a function without being wrapped in a `task` block.
**The new `selectAsync` and `selectTask` builders have the following new custom operations that are applied to the queried results:**

  * `toArray`
  * `toList`
  * `mapArray`
  * `mapList`
These new operations are designed to make the new select builders completely self-contained by removing the need to pipe the results.

#### They are Cleaner
Removing the need to pipeline the query builder into a `QueryContext` makes the code a bit more tidy.

### Creating a Custom `selectAsync` or `selectTask` Builder
If the redundancy of passing the generated `HydraReader.Read` static method into the `selectAsync` and `selectTask` builders bothers you, you can easily create your builder that has it baked-in:

```F#
let selectTask' ct = selectTask HydraReader.Read ct

// Usage:

let! distinctCustomerNames = 
    selectTask' (Create openContext) {
        for c in SalesLT.Customer do
        select (c.FirstName, c.LastName)
        distinct
    }
```

### Insert Builder

#### Simple Inserts
For simple inserts with no identity column and no included/excluded columns, use the `into _` syntax:

```F#
let! rowsInserted = 
    insertTask (Create openContext) {
        into Person.Person
        entity 
            {
                dbo.Person.ID = Guid.NewGuid()
                dbo.Person.FirstName = "Bojack"
                dbo.Person.LastName = "Horseman"
                dbo.Person.LastUpdated = DateTime.Now
            }
    }

printfn "Rows inserted: %i" rowsInserted
```

#### Insert with an Identity Field
If you have an Identity column or if you want to specify columns to include/exclude, use the `for _ in _ do` syntax.
By default, all record fields will be included as insert values, so when using an identity column, you must handle it in one of two ways:
1) Mark it with `getId`. This will prevent it from being added as an insert value, and it will also select and return the identity field.
2) Mark it with `excludeColumn` to prevent it from being added as an insert value.

```F#

let! errorLogID =
    insertTask (Create openContext) {
        for e in dbo.ErrorLog do
        entity 
            {
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorLogID = 0 // Adding `getId` below will ignore this value.
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorTime = System.DateTime.Now
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorLine = None
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorMessage = "TEST"
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorNumber = 400
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorProcedure = (Some "Procedure 400")
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorSeverity = None
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorState = None
                dbo.ErrorLog.UserName = "jmarr"
            }
        getId e.ErrorLogID
    }

printfn "ErrorLogID Identity: %i" errorLogID
```

#### Multiple Inserts
To insert multiple entities in one query, use the `entities` operation in conjunction with the `AtLeastOne` type to ensure that at least one item exists in the collection. (The `AtLeastOne` forces you to handle the case where an empty collection is passed to `entities` which would throw a runtime exception.)

NOTE: `getId` is not supported for multiple inserts with `entities`! So if you are inserting multiple entities that have an identity field, you must use `excludeColumn` on the identity column.

```F#
let currenciesMaybe = 
    [ 0..2 ] 
    |> List.map (fun i -> 
        {
            Sales.Currency.CurrencyCode = $"BC{i}"
            Sales.Currency.Name = "BitCoin"
            Sales.Currency.ModifiedDate = System.DateTime.Now
        }
    )
    |> AtLeastOne.tryCreate

match currenciesMaybe with
| Some currencies ->
    do! insertTask (Create openContext) {
            into Sales.Currency
            entities currencies
        } :> Task // upcast to Task if you want to ignore the resulting value
| None ->
    printfn "Skipping insert because entities seq was empty."
```

#### Upsert
Upsert support has been added for Postgres and Sqlite only because they support `ON CONFLICT DO ___` which provides atomic upsert capabilities.
(Unfortunately, SQL Server and Oracle only have MERGE which can suffer from concurrency issues. For SQL Server bulk operations, please try my [SqlBulkTools.Fsharp](https://github.com/JordanMarr/SqlBulkTools.FSharp) library.)

**Postgres:**
`open SqlHydra.Query.NpgsqlExtensions`

**Sqlite:**
`open SqlHydra.Query.SqliteExtensions`

**Example Usage:**

```F#
    /// Inserts an address or updates it if it already exists.
    let upsertAddress address = 
        insertTask (Create openContext) {
            for a in Person.Address do
            entity address
            onConflictDoUpdate a.AddressID (
                a.AddressLine1,
                a.AddressLine2,
                a.City,
                a.StateProvince,
                a.CountryRegion,
                a.PostalCode,
                a.ModifiedDate
            )
        }
```

Or, if you have multiple addresses to upsert:

```F#
    /// Inserts multiple addresses or updates them if they already exist.
    let upsertAddress addresses =
        match addresses |> AtLeastOne.tryCreate with
        | Some addresses -> 
            insertTask (Create openContext) {
                for a in Person.Address do
                entities addresses
                onConflictDoUpdate a.AddressID (
                    a.AddressLine1,
                    a.AddressLine2,
                    a.City,
                    a.StateProvince,
                    a.CountryRegion,
                    a.PostalCode,
                    a.ModifiedDate
                )
            }
        | None ->
            printfn "No addresses to insert."
            0
```

```F#
    /// Tries to insert an address if it doesn't already exist.
    let tryInsertAddress address = 
        insertTask (Create openContext) {
            for a in Person.Address do
            entity address
            onConflictDoNothing a.AddressID
        }
```


### Update Builder

#### Update Individual Fields
To update individual columns, use the `set` operation.

```F#
do! updateAsync (Create openContext) {
        for e in dbo.ErrorLog do
        set e.ErrorNumber 123
        set e.ErrorMessage "ERROR #123"
        set e.ErrorLine (Some 999)
        set e.ErrorProcedure None
        where (e.ErrorLogID = 1)
    } :> Task // upcast to Task if you want to ignore the resulting value
```

#### Update Entire Record
To update an entire record, use the `entity` operation.
You may optionally use `includeColumn` to specify an allow list of one or more columns on the record to include in the update.
You may optionally use `excludeColum` to specify a deny list of one or more columns on the record to exclude from the update.
NOTE: You may use `includeColumn` or `excludeColumn` multiple times - once for each column to include/exclude.

```F#
let! rowsUpdated = 
    updateTask (Create openContext) {
        for e in dbo.ErrorLog do
        entity 
            {
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorLogID = 0 // Add `excludeColumn` below to ignore an identity column
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorTime = System.DateTime.Now
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorLine = None
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorMessage = "TEST"
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorNumber = 400
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorProcedure = (Some "Procedure 400")
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorSeverity = None
                dbo.ErrorLog.ErrorState = None
                dbo.ErrorLog.UserName = "jmarr"
            }
        excludeColumn e.ErrorLogID // Exclude the identity column
        where (e.ErrorLogID = errorLog.ErrorLogID)
    }
```

If you want to apply an update to all records in a table, you must use the `updateAll` keyword or else it will throw an exception (it's a safety precaution that may save you some trouble. 😊):
```F#
update {
    for c in Sales.Customer do
    set c.AccountNumber "123"
    updateAll
}
```

### Delete Builder

```F#
do! deleteTask (Create openContext) {
        for e in dbo.ErrorLog do
        where (e.ErrorLogID = 5)
    } :> Task // upcast to Task if you want to ignore the resulting value
```

If you want to delete all records in a table, you must use the `deleteAll` keyword in lieu of a `where` statement or else it will not compile:
```F#
let! rowsDeleted = 
    deleteTask (Create openContext) {
        for c in Sales.Customer do
        deleteAll
    }
    
printfn "Rows deleted: %i" rowsDeleted
```

## Custom SqlKata Queries

SqlKata supports a lot of custom query operations, many of which are not supported by SqlHydra query builders.
The `kata` custom operation allows you to manipulate the underlying SqlKata query directly.
For example, you could use this to conditionally add columns to the WHERE or ORDER BY clauses:

```F#
let getCustomers filters = 
  select {
      for c in main.Customer do
      where (c.FirstName = "John")
      kata (fun query -> 
          match filters.LastName with
          | Some lastName -> query.Where("c.LastName", lastName)
          | None -> query
      )
      kata (fun query -> 
          query.OrderBy(filters.SortColumns)
      )
  }
```
